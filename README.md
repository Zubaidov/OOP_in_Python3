# OOP_in_Python3

## Introductuion
[+] Object Oriented Programming (OOP) allows programmers to create their own objects that have methods and attributes.
[+] Recall that after defining a string, list, dictionary, or other objects, you were able to call methods off of them with the .method_name() syntax.
[+] These methods act as functions that use information about the object, as well as the object itself to return results, or change the current object.

[+] For example this includes appending to a list, or counting the occurences of an element in a tuple

[+] For much larger scripts of the Python code, functions by themselves aren't enough for organization and repeatability.

[+] Commonly repeated tasks and objects can be defined with OOP to create code that is more usable.
